#Activate Google Earth Engine Python API

First, you need to request access to Google Earth Engine at https://signup.earthengine.google.com/. Then install gcloud, go to https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install and install gcloud CLI. After you have installed gcloud CLI it will automatically launch and let you authenticate with your GEE account (or gmail). Then close the Anaconda Prompt and restart it.

Now you are ready to start using the CoastSat toolbox!

⚠️ remember to always activate the environment with conda activate coastsat each time you are preparing to use the toolbox.
